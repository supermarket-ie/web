# supermarket.ie - Project Overview

## Vision
Smart grocery planning for Irish families. Premium feel, not coupon-clipping.

## Exit Strategy
Build valuable audience + data → acquisition by a supermarket.

## V1 MVP (Free)
**Core feature:** Enter family size → get personalized weekly shopping list + estimated cost

**User flow:**
1. Land on site
2. Enter family details (size, preferences)
3. Get smart weekly list with savings estimate
4. Email capture: "Get your personalized list every week"

**Key principles:**
- Premium, modern design — not classifieds/flyer vibes
- Don't explicitly rank supermarkets against each other
- Recommendations are implicit, not "X beats Y"
- Collect valuable behavioral data (family size, preferences, habits)

## What We're Building
- Landing page with tool
- Family size / preferences input
- Weekly list generator
- Email newsletter system
- Clean, fintech-style design

## List Generation: Hybrid Approach
**Phase 1 (Launch):** Colin curates weekly deals manually
- Pull deals from supermarket sites, flyers, apps
- Match to family profiles
- Quality control, fast to launch

**Phase 2 (Build in parallel):** Automated scraping
- Scripts pull prices/deals from supermarket sites
- Database of products + pricing
- Algorithm generates lists from family profiles
- Colin oversees and fixes when scrapers break

**Personalization logic:**
- Family size → quantity recommendations
- Preferences (dietary, etc.) → filters
- Location if relevant → store availability

## Monetization (Later)
- B2B: Brands/supermarkets pay for placement
- Affiliate/cashback potential
- Premium tier if there's a killer feature
- **Main goal:** Audience value for acquisition

## Audience Value Proposition
*"We have X engaged Irish households who trust us with their grocery planning. Here's what they buy, when, and why."*

## Market Context

## Marketing: ORGANIC FIRST
