# supermarket.ie - Design Brief

## Brand Positioning
Smart grocery planning for Irish families.
Premium, modern, trustworthy — not coupons-and-flyers.

## Vibe
Think: **Fintech meets lifestyle app**
- Monzo, Revolut (clean, friendly, trustworthy)
- Headspace (calm, approachable)
- Not: Groupon, coupon sites, busy supermarket flyers

## Color Palette (Ideas)

**Option A: Fresh & Clean**
- Primary: Deep green (#1B4D3E) — trust, freshness, Irish
- Accent: Warm coral (#FF6B5B) — friendly CTAs
- Background: Off-white (#FAFAFA)
- Text: Near-black (#1A1A1A)

**Option B: Modern & Bold**
- Primary: Navy (#0F172A) — premium, serious savings
- Accent: Bright teal (#14B8A6)
- Background: White
- Text: Slate gray

**Option C: Warm & Approachable**
- Primary: Forest green (#166534)
- Accent: Sunshine yellow (#FBBF24)
- Background: Cream (#FFFBEB)
- Text: Warm gray

Leaning toward **Option A** — green ties to groceries/Ireland, coral pops for actions.

## Typography
- Headlines: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Satoshi, or General Sans)
- Body: Clean, readable (Inter or system fonts for performance)
- No script fonts, nothing "sale-y"

---

## Landing Page Structure

### Above the fold
- Headline: "Smarter grocery shopping for Irish families"
- Subhead: "Get a personalized weekly list. Save time. Save money."
- CTA: "Build my list" or "Get started — it's free"
- Visual: Illustrated family or abstract grocery icons (not stock photos)

### How it works (3 steps)
1. Tell us about your household
2. Get your personalized weekly list
3. Shop smarter, save more

### Value props
- "Tailored to your family size"
- "Updated weekly with the best value"
- "No hunting through flyers"

### Social proof (when we have it)
- Testimonials, subscriber count, savings stats

### Email capture
- "Get your free weekly list"
- Family size selector + email input

### Footer
- About, Contact, Privacy
- Clean, minimal

## Key UI Components

**Family selector**
- Friendly icons or slider
- "Just me" / "Couple" / "Family of 3-4" / "5+"
- Optional: dietary preferences (vegetarian, etc.)

**Weekly list display**
- Card-based layout
- Product image, name, price, where to buy
- Category groupings (produce, dairy, etc.)
- Estimated total + savings

**Email signup**
- Inline form, not popup
- Clear value prop
- Minimal fields (email + family size)

---

## Illustrations vs Photography
Prefer **custom illustrations** or **clean icons**
- Stock photos feel generic
- Illustrations = distinctive brand
- Could use simple line illustrations of groceries, families

---

## Inspiration References
- notion.so (clean, spacious)
- linear.app (modern SaaS)
- monzo.com (friendly fintech)
- headspace.com (calm, approachable)
- too good to go app (food + savings without cheapness)

---

## What to Avoid
- Busy layouts
- Red/yellow "SALE" vibes
- Stock photos of happy families with groceries
- Cluttered coupon aesthetics
- Anything that looks like a supermarket flyer

---

## Next Steps
- Pick color direction
- Find/commission illustrations or icon set
- Wireframe landing page
- Build in Next.js
